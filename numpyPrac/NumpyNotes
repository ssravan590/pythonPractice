Numpy --> Numerical python Library
what is the need?
 by using python, we can perform mathematical operations
like
a+b
a-b
a*b

but to perform complex mathematical operations we  go for Numpy
--
1. Numpy define several function to perform complex mathematical operations
2. to fulfill performance gaps..and is implemented in c lang
3. nd array
     - n dimensional array or numpy array
