Types If Inheritance:
1. Single
2. Multi level
3. Hierarchical
4. Multiple
5. Hybrid
6. cyclic

1. Single :
     class P
         def m1(self)
           pass
     class C(p)
          def m2()
            pass
    here class c is sinsgle

2. Multi level:
     class P1
     class P2(p1)
     class P3(p2)

3.Hierarchical : single parent but multiple childs
      class P1
      class p2(p1)   and class P3(p1)

4.Multiple : supported
      class p1   and class P2
      class c(p1,p2) -------------> getting props from both class
          --> order of (p1,p2 ) is important if in case if a method clash the what order in order is 1st that method will be executed
5. Hybrid : combination of multiple and multilevel is called Hybrid
      class p1 and class p2
         class p3(p1,p2)
         class p4(p3)
      class p5(p4) class p6(p4)

      --> which  method to all in Hybrid depends of MRO Algoritham
      --> MRO also is also called as C3 Algo

6. Cyclic : Not supported
       class P1(P2)
       class P2(P1)


###Aliesing
def f1(function):
    print("f1 function got function argule",format(function))
    function()

def fx():
    print("fx function")

def fy():
    print("fy function")

-> IN python everything is treated as object even function also.
-> Every function is treated as Object
-> for Existing function we can give another name (function aliasing)
-> inside function , we can define another function(nexted function)
-> A function can return another function
-> we can pass a function as argument to another function.


_---------------------------

Python Generator
 -> it is a function
 -> It will generate a sequence of values
 -> generator will use yield keyword to generate values

range(),list and tuple are not generator
listA=[x for x in range(100)]
print(listA)
print(type(listA)) -- class list

genertorA=(x for x in range(100))
print(genertorA)
print(type(genertorA))

Traditional collections vs generator:
 -> with generators we will never face memory issue because it creates on demand
 -> In tradition collection all the obects are created in the begining itself

 Generator can created using yield value
